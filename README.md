# Opiskelijalounas Åbo for mobile devices.

## Launched on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opiskelijalounas&pli=1)

## What this is

This is a mobile version of [Obiskelijalounas](https://github.com/ollitoivanen/Obiskelijalounas), displaying the menus of student restaurants in Turku, Finland. It was built to make it easier to quickly check the menus of three main lunch providers in the city: Unica, Kårkafeerna and Sodexo.

## How it works

The app fetches the up-to-date menus from the lunch providers' websites. It then manipulates it to the correct format and displays it on the app.
